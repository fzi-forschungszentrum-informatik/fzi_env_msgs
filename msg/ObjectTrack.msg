# The ObjectTrack msg
#
# Holding Tracking information for an object.
#
####


# The identifier number of the object.
#
# In some algorithms the id 0 is used in a special manner e.g. being the ego vehicle itself.
# Invalid objects should be set using is_valid.
#
uint64 id

# Existence probability
#
# Incorporating several existence indicators into one probability value
#
float32 probability

# True iff this object is valid.
#
# This can be used to filter objects.
#
bool is_valid

# The number of time steps in which the object has been tracked.
#
# Minor information, could be removed in future.
#
uint32 age

# The number of time steps in which the object has not been observed by
# measurements (i.e. it was hidden). Then the current state is only a
# predicted state. To see if the object is currently hidden, check this
# for >0.
#
# Minor information, could be removed in future.
